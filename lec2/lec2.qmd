## Logistic population growth: hints

::: {style="font-size:29px"}
```{R echo = T, eval = T, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=4.25}
r <- 0.5
K <- 100
B <- 0:K # pick a range of B
dBdt <- r * B * (1 - B / K) # simulate dymamics
plot(B, dBdt,
  type = "l", lwd = 2,
  xlab = "Biomass (B)",
  ylab = "Growth rate (dB/dt)"
)
```

## Logistic population growth: hints

::: {style="font-size:29px"}
-   You need to add in a yield term (call it Y) to the equation and rearrange it
-   Differentiate Y with respect to B
-   Set the solution equal to zero and solve it (find the root)
-   Use your solution to calculate MSY and Umsy

<br>

-   **Bonus**. What happens if you repeat this exercise for the model:

$$
\frac{dB}{dt} = r B 
$$

## Why on earth are we doing this?

::: {style="font-size:28px"}
1.  Analytic solution is the best solution if it exists

2.  Biological reference points are not arbitrary, but rather emerge from biology of the system in question (or at least the models representing those systems)

3.  More complicated models have yield vs. biomass curves that skew left or right (develop intuition)

    -   Whales (often) skew right, fish (often) skew left

4.  Density dependence (i.e., compensation) as ***the*** ecological basis for sustainable harvesting

5.  Dependence of reference points on difference aspects of ecology

    -   Bmsy vs. Umsy

6.  Many critiques of MSY use this caricature of MSY

    -   What are the problems of this approach, and does it have any value in modern fisheries management?

## Equilibrium calculations in age-structured models 

::: {style="font-size:29px"}
-   Botsford and Wickham (1979) and Botsford (1981a, 1981b) developed a clever way to do many of the important equilibrium calculations needed for an age-structured analysis of fish population responses to harvesting
-   Approach integrates 'per-recruit' methods with stock-recruitment
-   Involves using survivorship-to-age-calculations in conjunction with age schedules of size, vulnerability, and fecundity to calculate equilibrium "incidence functions"
-   Each incidence function represents a sum over ages of some quantity like fecundity, weighted by survivorship
    -   Recognize survivorship is the net probability of surviving to some age
:::

## Survivorship in the fished condition

::: {style="font-size:26px"}
-   The following recursion captures the cumulative effect of fishing and natural mortality on animals as they age:

$$
\mathrm{lx}_a =
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
  &1 & \text{if } a = 1 \\\\
  &\mathrm{lx}_{a-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{a-1}} & \text{if } 2 \leq a < a_{\max} \\\\
  &\dfrac{\mathrm{lx}_{a_{\max}-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{a_{\max}-1}}}{1 - e^{-Z_{a_{\max}}}} & \text{if } a = a_{\max}
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

where:

$$
Z_{a} = F\cdot \mathrm{vul}_{a} + M
$$

-   F and M are instantaneous fishing and natural mortality
-   Z is total instantaneous mortality
-   $\mathrm{vul}_{a}$ is the vulnerability of an individual of age a to fishing

[Walters and Martell 2004 box 3.1]{.footerRight}
:::

## Plus group misery ðŸ˜­

::: {style="font-size:31px"}
For the plus group, we sum all untracked survivors:

$$
\mathrm{lx}_{a_{\max}} = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mathrm{lx}_{a_{\max}-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{a_{\max}-1}} \cdot \left(e^{-Z_{a_{\max}}}\right)^{j-1}
$$

This is a geometric series with:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^\infty r^j = \frac{1}{1 - r}, \quad \text{where } r = e^{-Z_{a_{\max}}}
$$

So:

$$
\mathrm{lx}_{a_{\max}} = \mathrm{lx}_{a_{\max}-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{a_{\max}-1}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - e^{-Z_{a_{\max}}}} = \frac{\mathrm{lx}_{a_{\max}-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{a_{\max}-1}}}{1 - e^{-Z_{a_{\max}}}}
$$

## Survivorship in the fished condition cont'd

::: {style="font-size:27px"}
-   A population at equilibrium with R recruits at age-1 should have $R\cdot lx_{a=2}$ age two year olds, and $R\cdot lx_{a=3}$ three year olds, etc.

-   The annual egg production of the population at that fished equilibrium is then

$$
\mathrm{ef} = \mathrm{R} \cdot \sum_{a=1}^{a_{max}} \mathrm{lx}_a \cdot \mathrm{f}_{a}
$$

-   where $\mathrm{f}_{a}$ is average fecundity at age

-   Incidence function approach allows us to write important quantities, e.g., spawner biomass per recruit in the fished condition (sbrf):

$$
\mathrm{sbrf} = \sum_{a=1}^{a_{max}} \mathrm{lx}_a \cdot \mathrm{w}_{a} \cdot\mathrm{mat}_{a}
$$

-   Which is the average amount of spawner biomass that one recruit produces over its lifetime given this survivorship schedule, where $\mathrm{w}_{a}$ and $\mathrm{mat}_{a}$ are weight and proportion mature at age

## [The power of Botsford incidence functions]{style="font-size:80%"}

::: {style="font-size:28px"}
-   If we distinguish between survivorship in the fished $\mathrm{lx}_a$ and unfished $\mathrm{lo}_a$ condition, a blank canvas awaits

$$
\mathrm{sbrf} = \sum_{a=1}^{a_{max}} \mathrm{lx}_a \cdot \mathrm{w}_{a} \cdot\mathrm{mat}_{a}
$$

vs.

$$
\mathrm{sbro} = \sum_{a=1}^{a_{max}} \mathrm{lo}_a \cdot \mathrm{w}_{a} \cdot\mathrm{mat}_{a}
$$

-   Can you use this logic to calculate vulnerable biomass per recruit in the fished and unfished condition (i.e., vbrf, vbro)?

-   What about vulnerable biomass in the fished and unfished condition (i.e., vbf, vbo)?

-   Recognize that in the literature these get different symbols i.e., $\mathrm{ef}$ vs. $\phi_e$

## [Botsford's most useful trick]{style="font-size:80%"}

::: {style="font-size:28px"}
-   At any fished equilibrium, we can write the amount of spawner biomass generated on average as a function of the life history vectors weighted by the probability of surviving to each of those ages (i.e., as a function of F)

$$
\mathrm{S = R \cdot sbrf}
$$

-   Allows us to re-write the Beverton-Holt and Ricker stock recruitment curves in terms of equilibrium recruitment given some fully vulnerable F

$$
\mathrm{R=\frac{\alpha S}{1+\beta S} \quad \text { where } \quad S=R \cdot \operatorname{sbrf} \Rightarrow \quad R=\frac{\alpha \cdot R \cdot \text { sbrf }}{1+\beta \cdot R \cdot \text { sbrf }}}
$$

-   And solving for equilibrium R:

$$
\mathrm{R=\frac{\alpha \cdot \mathrm{sbrf} - 1}{\beta \cdot \mathrm{sbrf}}}.

-   Parameterizing stock-recruitment in terms of Ro and recK

-   Consider a population at unfished equilibrium $$
    \mathrm{So = Ro \cdot sbro}
    $$

-   So and Ro are spawner biomass and recruitment at unfished equilibrium, so recruits per spawner in the unfished state is

$$
\text{recK} = \frac{\text{recruits per spawner biomass at low density}}{\text{recruits per spawner biomass at unfished density}} \\
\alpha \quad \text{is defined as recruits per spawner biomass at low density} \\
\frac{R_0}{S_0} = \frac{1}{\text{sbro}} 
\quad \text{(recruits per spawner biomass at unfished density)} \\
\Rightarrow \quad
\alpha = \frac{\text{recK}}{\text{sbro}}

-   Calculating $\beta$ from Ro, sbro, and recK:

$$
\mathrm{R=\frac{\alpha S}{1+\beta S} \quad \text { where } \quad So = Ro \cdot \operatorname{sbro} \Rightarrow \quad Ro=\frac{\alpha \cdot Ro \cdot \text { sbro }}{1+\beta \cdot Ro \cdot \text { sbro }}}

$$
\mathrm{\beta=\frac{\alpha \cdot \mathrm{sbro} - 1}{Ro \cdot \mathrm{sbro}}}.

## One more equation: yield per recruit

::: {style="font-size:28px"}
-   Recall that at equilibrium

$$
\mathrm{S = R \cdot sbrf}
$$

-   Equilibrium yield (Y) can be defined as a function of fully vulnerable instantaneous fishing mortality (F):

$$
Y(F) = R(F) \cdot \text{YPR}(F)
$$

-   Where R(F) is recruitment as a function of fishing mortality and yield per recruit (YPR) is specified as

$$
\operatorname{YPR}(F)= \mathrm{\sum_{a=1}^{a_{\max}} \frac{w_{a} \cdot vul_{a} \cdot F}{Z_{a}} \cdot \text{lx}_{a} \cdot\left(1-e^{-Z_{a}}\right)}
$$

-   Do people want to try and calculate equilibrium yield as a function of F? ðŸ¤”

:::

## [Equilibrium $F_{MSY}$ and $MSY$ calculations in age-structured fisheries models]{style="font-size:80%"}

::: {style="font-size:26px"}

-   May help to think of it as a multi-step procedure:

$$
 \begin{array}{c}\text{Estimate} \\\text{stock-recruitment &} \\\text{life history}  \\\text{parameters}  \end{array}  \Rightarrow  \begin{array}{c}\text{Compute} \\\text{equilibrium} \\\text{recruitment} \\R^*(F)  \end{array}  \Rightarrow  \begin{array}{c}\text{Calculate} \\\text{equilibrium} \\\text{yield} \\Y^*(F)  \end{array}  \Rightarrow  \begin{array}{c}\text{Solve for } F \text{ that} \\ \text{ maximizes } Y^*(F)  \end{array} 
$$

- Find the F that maximizes Y:

$$
F_{\text{MSY}} = F = \arg \max _{F} Y(F)
$$

- How might we solve this? 

[see methods Walters and Martell box 3.1]{.footerRight}
:::

## Proxy reference points

::: {style="font-size:29px"}

-   In the absence of stock recruitment, sometimes a fraction of So (i.e., 0.3-0.4So) is used as a proxy for MSY 
-   Depends on risk tolerance and biology 
-   What do you think? 

:::

## Key caveats and known failure points

::: {style="font-size:29px"}

-  Dome shaped vulnerability
-  Interaction of vulnerability and maturity schedule
-  High values of Fmsy
    - This can arise, but you want to know why this is happening
-  Ricker vs. Beverton-Holt
- Bias correcting parameters: if you bias correct something and then plug it into another equation...
- Still an equilibrium answer!
